## Credit Default Prediction

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to improve the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that a customer will experience financial distress in the next two years given his record present in the dataset.

## Dataset: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data)

## Libraries Used:
```
Python 3
Jupyter
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Scipy
```
## Run Instructions:
I ran all the experiments in the notebooks using Google Collaboratory.

## Performance:
Algorithm | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Light GBM | XGBoost |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
ROC-AUC | 85.49 | 86.54 | 86.15 | 85.53 |

The Random Forest outstands other ML algorithms' performance in terms of ROC-AUC.
