## Credit Default Prediction

OBJECTIVE: The aim is to improve on the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that customer will experience financial distress in the next two years given his record present in the dataset.

## Dataset: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data)

## Libraries Used:
```
Python 3
Jupyter
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Scipy
```
## Run Instructions:
I ran all the experiments in the notebooks using Google Collaboratory.

## Performance:
Algorithm | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Light GBM | XGBoost |
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |
ROC-AUC | 85.49 | 86.54 | 86.15 | 85.53 |

The Random Forest outstand other ML algorithms performed in terms of ROC-AUC metric.
